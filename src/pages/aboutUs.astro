        Café Stile is a coffee shop running by an italian man who wanted to create an unique
        experience where each waitress will treat you in a different way. So you
        can enjoy a good blend while you are attended in the way you prefer. Our
        blends use high quality organic coffee grains, we also have great
        pastry. If you want some main dishes we offer some good options like our
        iconic omurice. We'll waiting for you!
