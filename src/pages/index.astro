          Stile is a Caf√© running by an italian man who wanted to create an
          unique experience where each waitress will treat you in a different
          way. So you can enjoy a good blend while you are attended in the way
          you prefer. Our blends use high quality organic coffee grains, we also
          have great pastry. If you want some main dishes we offer some good
          options like our iconic omurice. We'll waiting for you!
